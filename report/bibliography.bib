abstract = {Based on two-port measurements, a distributed compact model and an extraction method for the power bus of a high-speed memory chip are proposed. The 1-D model is constructed according to the relative locations of the power and ground pads on the chip. The power bus around each power or ground pad is modeled by a section of resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) T-model, and the complete distributed model is formed by cascading all the T-model sections. The T-model at each section can be extracted through the measured two-port Z-parameters by using the Powell's optimization method. Because the model is extracted from measured data, detailed (or proprietary) chip-layout information is not necessary. Another advantage is this compact model keeps the broadband accuracy by the distribution concept and is easy to link with the package model for the power integrity codesign.},

  abstract={Under the platform of a high-speed double-data-rate three (DDR3) memory module, a modeling method considering all the significant effects from the chip, package, and board levels is developed to identify and investigate the critical nets affecting the signal or power integrity (SI/PI). For SI part, accurate modeling strategies for signal channels are verified by experiments on samples of address lines. The following what-if analyses of eye diagrams help to identify the discontinuities of package trace to be the bottlenecks and have great effects on the eye diagrams. For PI issues, the modeling methodologies for power distribution networks of data buses are demonstrated and validated with the results of measurement. The analysis indicates that the parasitic effects of the low-cost package structure are the most critical, depicting the importance of improved package design in the next-generation DDR memory modules.},
